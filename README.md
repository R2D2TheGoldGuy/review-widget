TIPS AND TRICKS

A solution will not be provided for the lab. But, to try to help you out, here are some tips you might find helpful.

First, break the requirements down into steps, and then implement each step. For example, for the hover requirements:

1. The user hovers over a circle. That circle, and all the ones to its left, must be highlighted.
2. To implement this, we must first discover what circle the user has moved their mouse over.
3. Then, we need to select that circle, and the ones to the left of it in the collection of circles.
4. We must highlight those circles. This can be done by adding a class to those circles. The class provided is highlight.
5. We must ensure the circles to the right aren't highlighted. You could do this by removing the highlight class.

Some methods you might find helpful:

Please note that not all of the methods listed above are needed for the answer.
